                    camera called, the Peep, to count and analyze traffic. Within each of these applications, was bound the

                <p>Hashbrown Systems has been purveyor of Outdoor Media and Advertising for some time. Our OOH Media
                  Monitoring System was managing over 200,000 outdoor locations, which also included unauthorized wall
                  paintings and transit media, at any moment. The company had also acquired substantial expertise in Data

                <p>We performed a pilot study of about 88 billboard locations in Delhi and measured the traffic. We further
                  analyzed the area, particularly the government zones of the city for demographics, vehicle ownership,
                  literacy, gender ratio, apart from quoted monthly costs of the billboards.</p>

                <p>By applying some rudimentary machine learning techniques, we were able to able to build an allocation

                <p>After we verified the first three results by sending people on the ground and tallying the results, one
                  of us wanted to leap out of our bathtub and run into the streets of Syracuse shouting, ‘Eureka! Eureka!’
                  But it was not to me as there were stringent laws against public nudity in Chandigarh and our findings
                  were far from getting accepted by the outdoor advertising industry at large.</p>

                <p>If we could allocate funds for 88 locations in one particular region, we could do so for the whole state,

                <p>Our first brush with the industry was encouraging to say the least, it reminded us of the not too old an

                  newer technology into the oldest form of advertisements, had ignored or made assumption of needs and
